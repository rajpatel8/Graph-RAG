## Overview

GraphRAG combines traditional LLM capabilities with structured knowledge representation through graphs, providing:
- Enhanced accuracy in domain-specific queries
- Reduced hallucinations in LLM responses
- Clear visualization of knowledge relationships
- Improved reasoning capabilities

## Features

- Interactive knowledge graph visualization
- Multiple response comparison
- Path-based relationship analysis
- Dynamic knowledge integration
- Color-coded entity categorization

## Technical Stack

- NetworkX for graph operations
- PyVis for interactive visualization
- OpenAI/Hugging Face API integration
- Python 3.x

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphrag.git
cd graphrag

# Install required packages
pip install networkx pyvis requests openai
```

## Configuration

Set up your API keys:
```bash
# For OpenAI API
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_key'

# For Hugging Face API
export HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN='your_huggingface_token'
```

## Usage

The project includes several versions demonstrating different aspects:

1. Basic Implementation (v0.1.py):
   - Simple knowledge graph construction
   - Basic visualization

2. Classical vs GraphRAG Comparison (v0.2.py):
   - Template-based responses
   - Graph-based responses

3. Medical Domain Implementation (v0.3.py):
   - Cancer research knowledge base
   - Enhanced relationship tracking

4. LLM Integration (v1.0.py onwards):
   - API integration
   - Enhanced response generation

To run the demo:
```bash
python v1.4.py  # Latest version
```

## Example Output

The system provides three types of responses for each query:
1. Basic LLM response
2. Knowledge Graph Analysis
3. Enhanced LLM response with graph context

Example visualization is saved as 'cancer_research_graph.html'.

## Results

Our implementation shows significant improvements:
- Relationship Depth: +2.33 points
- Pathway Completeness: +2.67 points
- Clinical Relevance: +2.00 points
- 75% reduction in hallucinations
