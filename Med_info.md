# Key Medical Terms in the Demo Explained

## Main Components

### Drugs and Treatments
- **Trastuzumab (Herceptin)**
  - A targeted cancer drug
  - Used specifically for breast cancer patients
  - Works like a smart missile that targets specific cancer cells
  - Commercial name: Herceptin

### Proteins and Genes
- **HER2**
  - A protein found on the surface of cells
  - When there's too much (overexpression), it can make cells grow uncontrollably
  - Think of it like a "growth switch" that gets stuck in the "on" position

- **ERBB2**
  - The gene that contains instructions for making HER2 protein
  - Like a blueprint that tells the cell how to make HER2
  - When this gene has problems, it can lead to too much HER2

- **BRCA1**
  - A gene that helps repair damaged DNA
  - Known as the "breast cancer gene"
  - When damaged, it can't fix DNA problems, leading to higher cancer risk

### Biological Processes
- **PI3K Pathway**
  - A series of chemical reactions in cells
  - Like a relay race passing signals that tell cells to grow
  - When overactive, can cause uncontrolled cell growth

- **Cell Growth & Survival**
  - Normal processes that keep cells healthy
  - In cancer, these processes become uncontrolled
  - Like a car with a stuck accelerator

### Side Effects
- **Cardiotoxicity**
  - Harmful effects on the heart
  - A possible side effect of some cancer treatments
  - Can cause heart muscle damage or heart function problems

## Why This Demo is Important

This example shows how GraphRAG is better than traditional AI because it can:
1. Connect the dots between drugs and their effects
2. Show why certain treatments work for specific types of cancer
3. Explain complex relationships between genes, proteins, and cancer
4. Help predict potential side effects

## Simple Analogy

Think of this system like a GPS for cancer treatment:
- Classical AI is like having separate street maps that don't connect
- GraphRAG is like having a complete GPS system that shows all possible routes and connections
- The knowledge graph shows not just the destinations, but all the paths between them

## Example Usage

When someone asks "Why does Trastuzumab work for breast cancer?", GraphRAG can show the complete path:
1. Trastuzumab targets HER2 protein
2. HER2 is often overexpressed in breast cancer
3. By blocking HER2, it stops the cancer growth signals
4. This helps control the cancer

This kind of connected understanding is crucial for:
- Doctors explaining treatments to patients
- Researchers developing new drugs
- Understanding why some treatments work better for certain patients
