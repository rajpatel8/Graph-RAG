# Demo Scenario: Cancer Treatment Planning

## Setup
"Imagine a doctor needs to explain to a patient why they're recommending Trastuzumab (Herceptin) for breast cancer treatment."

## Query Examples

1. Basic Question:
   "Why should we use Trastuzumab for this breast cancer case?"

   - Classical AI might say:
     "Trastuzumab is a drug that treats breast cancer"

   - GraphRAG will show:
     - The drug specifically targets HER2 protein
     - How it works through specific biological pathways
     - Why it's effective for HER2-positive breast cancer
     - Potential side effects to watch for

2. Safety Question:
   "What are the risks of this treatment?"

   - Classical AI might say:
     "Trastuzumab can have side effects"

   - GraphRAG will show:
     - Specific side effects like cardiotoxicity
     - Why these side effects occur
     - How they're connected to the drug's mechanism
     - What monitoring might be needed

## Why It's Better

1. More Complete Information:
   - Shows full pathways from drug to effect
   - Explains both benefits and risks
   - Connects different pieces of information

2. Better Decision Support:
   - Helps understand why treatments are chosen
   - Shows what to monitor during treatment
   - Explains connections between different aspects of treatment

This scenario demonstrates how GraphRAG provides more useful, connected information for real-world medical decisions.
